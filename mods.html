                <h3>Create: Enchantment Industry</h3>
                <p>A mod addon for Create that provides automated and enhanced experience/enchantment mechanics, such as liquid XP storage and transport, mechanical grindstones with extra functions, blaze-powered enchanters/anvils, automated book/printer systems, experience lanterns that integrate into contraptions, hyper-enchant mechanisms for bypassing enchantment level caps, and mending-on-belt repair via liquid XP.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="mod-card">
                <h3>Pxl’s Paths</h3>
                <p>Automatically creates “desire paths” where players walk frequently: grass wears down over time to reveal beaten paths, showing on maps, with configurable growth and regrowth of terrain (including sand trails), giving a natural trail aesthetic without manual digging.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="mod-card">
                <h3>TerraBlender</h3>
                <p>A library/API mod for biome and terrain modders, offering simple, compatible methods to add or blend custom biomes into Minecraft’s world generation under the new biome/terrain system, ensuring consistency with vanilla and other mods’ biome distributions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mod-card">
                <h3>Double Doors</h3>
                <p>A lightweight utility mod enabling identical double doors (as well as trapdoors and fence gates) to open/close simultaneously when either side is activated—clicking one door, pressure plate, or redstone on one side opens/closes the other(s) within a configurable search radius. Crouching disables the double-open feature for individual control.</p>
            </div>

			<div>
				<h3>Biomes O' Plenty</h3>
				<p>An expansive biome mod adding dozens of new, unique biomes across the Overworld, Nether, and End, along with new plants, trees, blocks, and related world-generation content. It requires supporting libraries (e.g., GlitchCore, TerraBlender) in newer versions, and integrates seamlessly into world creation to greatly diversify exploration.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>GlitchCore</h3>
				<p>A core library mod abstracting differences between mod loaders (Forge/Fabric/NeoForge/Quilt) and providing utilities commonly used by other mods in the same ecosystem. Many mods (e.g., Biomes O’ Plenty, Serene Seasons, Tough As Nails) depend on this for cross-loader compatibility.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Easy Magic</h3>
				<p>Improves the vanilla enchantment table experience: items placed in the table remain in its inventory after closing, rendered floating around; the enchanting UI shows full potential enchantments and includes a reroll button at low XP/lapis cost; bookshelves requirements and placement rules become configurable; supports automation (e.g., hoppers) and underwater use of tables; streamlines enchanting without breaking game balance.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Puzzles Lib</h3>
				<p>A lightweight core library/framework mod offering abstractions and utility classes for loader-specific code, designed primarily to support other mods by the same author (e.g., Easy Magic). It does nothing on its own but is required by dependent mods to function across Forge and Fabric.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Reskillable</h3>
				<p>Adds a configurable skill-tree progression: players spend XP to level up various skills (e.g., mining, combat, crafting), unlocking the ability to use/break/craft stronger items or interact with certain blocks/mobs only after reaching required levels. Vanilla behaviors (e.g., requiring shears for wool) can be toggled, and all requirements are JSON-configurable to customize progression.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Burnt</h3>
				<p>Enhances vanilla fire mechanics so that lighting flint-and-steel or burning spreads realistically and leaves behind burnt variants (smoldering blocks, ash drops, charcoal yields, etc.), allowing fire to meaningfully alter environments rather than instantly destroying blocks. Works with Supplementaries for ash, offers new “burnt” block variants, and adds tools (e.g., flint bow) to trigger fires intentionally.</p>
